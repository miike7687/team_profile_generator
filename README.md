### Description

I have created a node CLI to dynamically generate members of a team based on user's input using the inquirer package.

### Process

- First I added my classes and ran the tests for each class.
- Then I worked on my app.js file to create my inquirer questions to prompt the user.
- I also created a team array to store all of my team members' information.
- Then I created some helper functions (generateHtml, newTeamMember)
- I continued to run tests to check to see if everything works.

### Installation

- I installed this application through node.js.

### Usage

- My application would be used to create a display of team members in an efficient and visually pleasing way.
